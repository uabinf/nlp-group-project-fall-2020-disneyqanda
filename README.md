## Installation
```python
pip install git+https://github.com/uabinf/nlp-group-project-fall-2020-disneyqanda
```
## Usage
```python
import disneyqanda
```
## How it works
Ask a question about Disney World or Disney Land.
Disney Q & A has 4 main sections:
1) Data Retrieval
    * Use selenium to go to each webpage and BeautifulSoup to parse the data found in each webpage
    * Disney World
        * Go through 4 main categories: Walt Disney World Resort, Vacation Planning, MyMagic+, Website Support
        * Within the 4 main categories: go through subcategories which contain the list of questions
        * For each subcategory, get the list of questions with their answers
    * Disneyland
        * Go through 4 main categories: Disneyland Resort, Vacation Planning, Technical Support
        * Within the 4 main categories: go through subcategories which contain the list of questions
        * For each subcategory, get the list of questions with their answers
    * Create a textfile with the list of questions and answers in the following format:
        Q1
        A1
        Q2
        A2
        ....
2) Question Processing
    * Basic processing
        * Tokenize
        * Remove stopwords
        * POS tag
        * Remove punctuation
    * Get question words
    * Find key words 
        * Search against custom Disney entity list
        * Add adjective/noun pairs
    * Find focus
        * Dependency parsing
        * Get root word and words dependent on the root
        * Get nouns dependent on root and adjectives or nouns describing them
    * Determine answer type
        * nltk Naive Bayes model trained on lableed questions
        * Use features from question processing for the model
3) Document Processing
    * Document Retrieval
        * Read documents, join corresponding questions and answers
    * Document Segmentation
        * Given the list of documents from document retrieval, iterate through the questions and check to see if keywords from question processing appear in the question.
        * If there are keywords that match, add the answer to a list 
        * Returns a list of possible answers
    * Passage Retrieval 
        * Get the list of answers from Document Segmentation
    * Passage Ranking 
        * Doc2Vec model trained on all Disney questions and answers
        * Get embeddings of question being asked and questions mined from Disney
        * Use cosine similarity to get most similar questions
4) Answer Processing
    * NER tagger 
        * Search against custom Disney entity list
    * Candidate answers
        * Get questions with most matching words to question being asked
    * Ranking candidates
        * Check named entities in questions and answers
        * Check the answer type for each candidate answer's question
        * Choose the best match base on these features
